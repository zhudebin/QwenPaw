"""MCP stateful clients with proper cross-task lifecycle management.

This module provides drop-in replacements for AgentScope's MCP clients
that solve the CPU leak issue caused by cross-task context manager exits.

The issue occurs when using AgentScope's StatefulClientBase in uvicorn/FastAPI:
- connect() enters AsyncExitStack in task A (e.g., startup event)
- close() exits AsyncExitStack in task B (e.g., reload background task)
- anyio.CancelScope requires enter/exit in the same task
- Error is silently ignored, leaving MCP processes and streams uncleaned

Our solution: Run the entire context manager lifecycle in a single dedicated
background task, using event-based signaling for reload/stop operations.

        **HTTP / streamable_http scenario**
        ``streamable_http_client``'s ``post_writer`` background task silently
        closes ``write_stream`` in its ``finally`` block when an internal
        error occurs (e.g. HTTP read timeout after 300 s).  The lifecycle
        loop keeps seeing ``is_connected=True`` because the failure never
        propagates to it.  Without this handler every subsequent
        ``call_tool`` call would raise ``anyio.ClosedResourceError``
        indefinitely — the client would never recover without a process
        restart.

        **StdIO scenario**
        If the MCP subprocess exits unexpectedly, the stdio pipe breaks and
        subsequent ``call_tool`` calls raise ``BrokenPipeError``,
        ``EOFError``, or ``anyio.ClosedResourceError``.  The same handler
        detects these and triggers a reconnect.  For StdIO, reconnecting
        means spawning a *new* subprocess.  The lifecycle task exits the
        current ``AsyncExitStack`` (which terminates the dead/old subprocess)
        and then opens a fresh one, so there is no subprocess accumulation.

        By proactively setting ``is_connected=False`` and firing
        ``_reload_event``, we ensure the lifecycle loop's inner 0.1 s poll
        detects the dead stream and tears down the old context before opening
        a fresh connection.

        Note: ``self.session`` is intentionally *not* cleared here.
        ``_validate_connection`` checks ``is_connected`` first, so the stale
        ``session`` reference is never reached before the lifecycle task
        replaces it.  Clearing it here would require a lock (the lifecycle
        task also writes ``session``), adding unnecessary complexity.

    - Context manager enter/exit happens in the same asyncio task
    - Uses event-based signaling for reload/stop operations
    - Properly cleans up MCP subprocess and stdio streams
    - No CPU leak on reload
    - No zombie processes
