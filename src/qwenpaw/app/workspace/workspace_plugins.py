"""Per-workspace pluggable layer.

Holds the three per-workspace registries that ``Runtime.run()``
reads each request:

* :class:`SlashCommandRegistry` — slash dispatch
* :class:`HookRegistry`         — 8-phase hook orchestration
* ``modes``                     — list of :class:`AgentMode` instances

Every field is **per-workspace** — no cross-workspace sharing. The
matching cross-workspace container is ``AppServiceManager`` and is strictly
limited to its three coordinators (see ``app/app_services/``).
