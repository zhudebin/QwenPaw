CloudPaw is a cloud capability enhancement plugin for QwenPaw, combining **QwenPaw + Aliyun CLI** with deep **IaC** integration. It's not just a chatbot — it's an intelligent assistant with a cloud-native execution engine.

Simply describe your needs in natural language, and CloudPaw will automate the entire process from resource creation to application deployment. For example:

- **One-sentence app deployment**: Tell CloudPaw "Help me build a personal website" — it will automatically create an ECS instance, configure security groups, deploy the application, and return an accessible URL.
- **Quick personal site launch**: Describe the content and style you want, and CloudPaw generates the code, deploys to the cloud, and binds a public endpoint.
- **Rapid API service publishing**: Specify your interface definitions, and CloudPaw handles the full pipeline from code generation and container building to service exposure.

CloudPaw runs entirely in your own environment, keeping your data secure and under your control.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **QwenPaw version** | **≥ v1.1.7** |
| **Python** | 3.10 ~ 3.13 |
| **Alibaba Cloud account** | Access Key required for cloud operations |

> For QwenPaw installation, see [QwenPaw Quickstart](https://qwenpaw.agentscope.io/docs/quickstart). If your QwenPaw version is below v1.1.7, upgrade first: `pip install --upgrade qwenpaw>=1.1.7`.

### 1. Install CloudPaw Plugin

**Via Console (recommended):**

1. Launch QwenPaw (`qwenpaw app`), open http://127.0.0.1:8088/
2. Click "Plugin Manager" in the left sidebar (under Settings), then click "Install Plugin"
3. Install using either method:
   - Enter the plugin download URL: `https://qwenpaw-download.oss-ap-southeast-1.aliyuncs.com/files/plugins/cloudpaw/cloudpaw-0.0.3.zip`
   - Drag the `cloudpaw/` folder into the install dialog, or select a ZIP file (CloudPaw is pre-bundled with QwenPaw v1.1.7+ at `plugins/bundle/cloudpaw/`)
4. Wait for installation to complete

**Via CLI:**

```bash
qwenpaw plugin install /path/to/cloudpaw
# Or install via URL
qwenpaw plugin install https://qwenpaw-download.oss-ap-southeast-1.aliyuncs.com/files/plugins/cloudpaw/cloudpaw-0.0.3.zip
```

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: After installation, you MUST hard-refresh the browser** (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`) to load frontend updates. CloudPaw's custom UI components (proposal selection, PRD management, etc.) will not appear until the page is refreshed. If features seem missing after install, try refreshing first.

### 2. Configure

After installing CloudPaw, complete these configurations:

#### ① QwenPaw Model

Configure an LLM provider and API Key in console Settings → Models. See [QwenPaw Models docs](https://qwenpaw.agentscope.io/docs/models).

#### ② Alibaba Cloud Credentials

Configure in console "Environment Variables" (CloudPaw auto-creates placeholder entries):

- `ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_ID` — your Access Key ID
- `ALIBABA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` — your Access Key Secret
- `ALIBABA_CLOUD_REGION_ID` — region ID (defaults to `cn-hangzhou`)

You can also configure via system environment variables or CLI. For instructions on obtaining Access Keys, refer to the [Alibaba Cloud documentation](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/116401.html). We recommend using a primary account Access Key with full permissions.

#### ③ iac-code Model Configuration

CloudPaw relies on [iac-code](https://github.com/aliyun/iac-code) (≥ 0.1.2) for IaC template generation. **No manual model configuration is needed** — CloudPaw automatically syncs QwenPaw's active model to iac-code.

When the CloudPaw plugin starts, it writes `llm_source: qwenpaw` to `~/.iac-code/settings.yml`. This tells iac-code to read model configuration (provider, API key, model name, etc.) directly from QwenPaw's active model. As long as you have configured a working model in QwenPaw (step ①), iac-code will use the same model automatically — no extra setup required.

**Manual override:** If you need iac-code to use a different model from QwenPaw, set the `IAC_CODE_PROVIDER` environment variable (via QwenPaw's Environment Variables page or system env). When this variable is present, CloudPaw skips automatic injection and iac-code uses your manual configuration. For details, see the [iac-code LLM configuration docs](https://aliyun.github.io/iac-code/docs/configuration/llm-providers).

### 3. Start Using

Select "CloudPaw-Master" from the agent dropdown in the chat page to start.

## Features

- **IaC Deployment Orchestration**: Automate Alibaba Cloud resource deployment via [iac-code](https://github.com/aliyun/iac-code) engine for ROS/Terraform template generation
- **Resource Proposal Selection**: Interactive multi-proposal comparison and selection with dedicated frontend rendering (`proposal_choice` tool)
- **PRD Management Frontend Enhancement**: Custom frontend rendering for QwenPaw Mission Mode's PRD management (`manage_prd` tool)
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Orchestrate multiple agents for complex deployment tasks via QwenPaw Mission Mode
- **Alibaba Cloud Skills Remote Agent Integration**: Connect and call remote agents hosted on Alibaba Cloud Skills Hub via A2A protocol with real-time streaming display
- **Auto-dependency Setup**: Automatically installs `iac-code` and Alibaba Cloud CLI during plugin startup

## Alibaba Cloud Skills Remote Agent Integration

CloudPaw supports connecting and invoking remote agents hosted on **Alibaba Cloud Skills Hub** via the **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol**, enabling cross-agent collaboration.

> **Note**: A2A functionality is currently only supported within the CloudPaw plugin and is limited to agents hosted on Alibaba Cloud Skills Hub. Connecting to other A2A agents may result in incompatibility issues.

### Usage

CloudPaw provides **two** ways to invoke remote A2A agents. Both methods are processed by the LLM and executed via the `a2a_call` tool:

#### Method 1: `/a2a` Command Quick Call

Send messages to a remote agent using the `/a2a` command in the chat box:

```
/a2a <alias> <message>
```

Example:

```
/a2a my-agent How do I deploy a Node.js app to ECS?
```

The command is automatically rewritten into an LLM-understandable instruction, which then invokes the `a2a_call` tool.

#### Method 2: Natural Language Call

Simply describe your needs in natural language, and the LLM will automatically determine whether to call a remote agent and execute it via the `a2a_call` tool:

```
Ask my-agent how to quickly deploy a Flask app to Alibaba Cloud?
```

In this mode, the LLM understands user intent and automatically selects the appropriate remote agent. This is ideal for scenarios requiring multi-turn conversations and context.

#### List Registered Agents

Enter `/a2a` without arguments to list all registered remote A2A agents and their connection status, similar to the `/skills` command for viewing installed skills.

### Notes

- A2A functionality is currently only supported within the CloudPaw plugin and is limited to agents hosted on Alibaba Cloud Skills Hub. Connecting to other A2A agents may result in incompatibility issues.
- When invoking remote agents, message content is sent to remote servers — please consider data security
- Only one active A2A call is supported at a time

## Multi-Agent Architecture

CloudPaw implements multi-agent collaboration via QwenPaw's **Mission Mode**. Users interact with the master agent, which automatically breaks down requirements into a PRD (Product Requirements Document) and delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents by story priority.

| Agent | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **CloudPaw-Master** | Orchestration: user dialogue, requirement clarification, PRD generation, task delegation, result aggregation |
| **CloudPaw-Executor** | General execution: code writing, app deployment, environment configuration, CLI operations |
| **CloudPaw-Verifier** | Unified verification: cloud resource status, app functionality, accessibility, security compliance |
| **iac-code** (External ACP Agent) | IaC engine: invoked asynchronously via ACP protocol for ROS/Terraform template generation, cost estimation, and stack management |

## Usage Examples

**Deploy a personal homepage to the cloud**

> Help me create a personal homepage and deploy it to the cloud. The page should include: personal introduction, skills, project experience, and contact info — please use placeholders for all personal information. The style should be clean and minimal, responsive for mobile and desktop. Please deploy using Alibaba Cloud ECS.

**Quickly publish an API service to the cloud**

> Help me quickly deploy an API service to the cloud. I want it to provide /health and /hello endpoints by default, and give me a callable URL with example requests. Keep the configuration as simple and clean as possible.
